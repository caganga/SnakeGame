# SnakeGame
I watched a youtube video about making a Snake Game and after that i learned stuff about JavaSwing that can help. 
This project helped me understand basics of the JavaSwing.
You can access the code and change color of the snake , background color, speed of the game.
I've tried different variations for width and length but i think this is the best because i was playing this on Nokia 3310.
